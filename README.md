# This tool allows you to patch your Scrap Mechanic game!

##What is a patch? 
A patch is essentially a mod, like you are familiar with. However, a patch modifies the Scrap Mechanic executable, raw binary!

## What can it do? 
Some of the patches include an Offline Patch that allows you to play Scrap Mechanic offline, and a Dev Mode patch that allows mismatching dev modes when joining worlds.
(Only 2 patches, more to come)

## Will I need to update it? 
Unless the functionality of the patch machine changes, not likely. New patches are released on GitHub, so simply by restarting the patch machine, allows the patch machine to fetch all available patches and load them for you!

## Why are my patches red? 
A red patch means 1 of 2 things. Either the patch itself has not been tested on your current game version, so its not supported, or it means that your game version is not detected/supported.

If there was a recent update to the game, just be patient while the patches are updated for your version. If there was not a recent update, you made need to [verify your files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tTMRLhN72U)

## How do I use it? 
You can download it directly from the GitHub page [Latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/TheGuy920/Scrap-Mechanic-Patch-Machine/releases) or subscribe to the mod, and use it from the mod folder

###Instructions:
 - Go to where you installed steam (usually here):
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\```
 - Then navigate to the mod download folder:
```\steamapps\workshop\content\387990\2782732282```
 - Run the **Scrap Mechanic Patch Machine.exe** and enjoy!

## This is great! What do I do next?
